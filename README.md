HERE IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT SHOWCASED HERE

TSP_project.py

A Python implementation of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using multiple optimization techniques, including a greedy nearest-neighbor search,
random perturbations, and a fully-tuned Simulated Annealing algorithm with advanced path manipulation and reset mechanisms. The project visualizes itineraries
and compares results for performance evaluation.

Convolutional_TF2.py

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify 32Ã—32 color (RGB) images into 10 distinct categories.
It is suitable for datasets such as CIFAR-10 or any similarly structured dataset loaded from Python pickle files.

scilearn.py

This project performs binary sentiment classification (positive/negative) on Amazon product reviews using scikit-learn's Logistic Regression and the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for text vectorization. It includes model training, evaluation, and prediction on new reviews.

# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm (market basket analysis.py)

This project implements Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and association rules from transaction data. It leverages Python libraries like `mlxtend`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` to preprocess data, generate rules, visualize patterns, and derive actionable insights such as recommendations and discount planning.
