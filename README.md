HERE IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT SHOWCASED HERE

A Python implementation of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using multiple optimization techniques, including a greedy nearest-neighbor search,
random perturbations, and a fully-tuned Simulated Annealing algorithm with advanced path manipulation and reset mechanisms. The project visualizes itineraries
and compares results for performance evaluation.
