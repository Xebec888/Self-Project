HERE IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT SHOWCASED HERE

TSP_project.py
A Python implementation of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using multiple optimization techniques, including a greedy nearest-neighbor search,
random perturbations, and a fully-tuned Simulated Annealing algorithm with advanced path manipulation and reset mechanisms. The project visualizes itineraries
and compares results for performance evaluation.

Convolutional_TF2.py
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify 32Ã—32 color (RGB) images into 10 distinct categories.
It is suitable for datasets such as CIFAR-10 or any similarly structured dataset loaded from Python pickle files.
